Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique in which the artistic style of one image (like a famous painting) is applied to the content of another image. The result is a blend of the content image and the style image, creating a new piece of artwork that retains the recognizable structure of the original content while adopting the visual style of the reference artwork.

Here’s how it works in basic steps:

Content Image: This is the image you want to preserve the structure of. For example, a photograph.

Style Image: This is the artwork or painting whose style you want to replicate (like Van Gogh’s "Starry Night").

Neural Network: The neural network (typically a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network like VGG-19) is used to extract features from both images—one for content and one for style.

Optimization: An optimization process combines the content and style features. The goal is to adjust a new image so that it minimizes the difference between the content of the original image and the style of the reference image.

Output: The final output is an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another.

Loss Functions:
Content Loss: Measures how much the content of the generated image differs from the content of the original image.
Style Loss: Measures how much the style of the generated image differs from the style of the reference image. This is often calculated using the Gram matrix, which represents the correlations between features at different layers.
Total Variation Loss (optional): Used to reduce noise in the generated image.
